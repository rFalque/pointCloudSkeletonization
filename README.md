# C++ implementation of "Point Cloud Skeletons via Laplacian-Based Contraction"

## What is in this repository?
This repository contains the C++ implementation of the point cloud skeletonization  based on the Laplacian-based contraction [[1]](#link-to-the-original-papers). In short, a point cloud is used as an input, a Laplacian operator is then built based on the concept of a one-ring neighbourhood. This operator is then used for contracting the point cloud. A skeleton is then built using farthest distance sampling with either a k-NN or a radius search.

Additionally, mesh skeletonization using the same method with the Laplacian defined on the mesh is also provided.

## Dependencies

## todo
* add parallelization

## Differences with the original paper [1]
* Different implementation of the laplacian
* The nodes are generated using the farthest sampling algorithm (using either a sphere or k-NN to find neighbours). The k-NN sampling allows to have nodes generated with respect to the points density
* Several skeleton trimming is available depending of the required skeleton type
